# Hotel-Performance-analysis

About this project
Goals: To analyze key hotel performance metrics and uncover actionable insights to drive revenue, optimize occupancy, and improve booking trends using Power BI. The project aims to support strategic decision-making by visualizing data effectively and identifying patterns in customer behavior and operational efficiency.

Business Needs: The hospitality industry requires tools to monitor and improve performance by identifying trends, optimizing pricing strategies, and assessing the efficiency of booking platforms and room categories. This project aims to bridge the gap between data and decision-making for hotel managers and stakeholders.

Process:

Data Preparation:
Utilized Power Query for data transformation, cleaning, and preprocessing.
Consolidated and shaped datasets for consistent and usable formats.
Metric Calculations:
Built custom measures using DAX, such as:
RevPAR: A key performance indicator measuring revenue per available room.
Occupancy Percentage: Reflecting the proportion of occupied rooms.
Realization Percentage: Indicating revenue potential captured across platforms.
ADR: Average revenue earned per room.
Dashboard Design:
Designed interactive dashboards using Power BI to highlight key metrics.
Developed slicers and filters to allow end-users to explore trends, such as peak booking periods, popular room types, and channel-wise bookings.
Insights and Outcomes:

Identified revenue growth opportunities by analyzing high-performing booking channels.
Improved understanding of occupancy trends, enabling data-driven pricing strategies.
Streamlined operations by highlighting areas of underperformance.
This project effectively combines Power Query, DAX, and advanced data visualizations in Power BI to present a comprehensive view of hotel performance, enabling data-driven decision-making.
